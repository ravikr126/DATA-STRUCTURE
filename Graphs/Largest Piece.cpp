Send Feedback
It's Gary's birthday today and he has ordered his favourite square cake consisting of '0's and '1's . But Gary wants the biggest piece of '1's and no '0's . A piece of cake is defined as a part which consist of only '1's, and all '1's share an edge with each other on the cake. Given the size of cake N and the cake, can you find the count of '1's in the biggest piece of '1's for Gary ?
Input Format :
The first line of input contains an integer, that denotes the value of N. 
Each of the following N lines contain N space separated integers.
Output Format :
Print the count of '1's in the biggest piece of '1's, according to the description in the task.
Constraints :
1 <= N <= 1000
Time Limit: 1 sec
Sample Input 1:
2
1 1
0 1
Sample Output 1:
3
